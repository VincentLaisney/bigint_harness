Generation of random big-ints and five-operator calculations on them

Generation of random big-ints and possibility of reading a list of calculation for doing them again (with another program) to control the accuracy.

This project was begun to control the accuracy of the math.big library of V language which show itself erroneous on the square_root_by_hand program of rosettacode.
